## Sailboat Price Analysis
Our team analyzed the factors of sailboat prices and trained a ML model to predict future prices. 

- Sailboat data was provided from Problem Y from the 2023 MCM competition.
- We scraped additional economic data (GDP, HDI) for each region.
- Correlation analysis and principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the input space.
- Chi-square tests were used to rank the importance of each individual factor in the resulting sailboat price.

We scraped Hong Kong sailboat price data from https://www.yachtworld.com/boats-for-sale/country-hong-kong/ and used it to test our model on.
